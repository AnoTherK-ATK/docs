# AnoTherK's docs

This is the place I write things about what I know or don't know. The first target is teach about basic programming and DSA.

## If you want to contribute

Just clone it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/AnoTherK-ATK/docs.git
```

Use `pnpm` to install modules:

```sh
pnpm install
```

And run:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

You should read about [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) to know about components and syntax.

That's it.

Have fun.
